Made a random number generator 

Introduction
---------------

I added two versions to this code showing my progression.

Version 1 is simple generates random numbers from 1 - 100,
Version 2 is the same iteration of version onebut adds an option menu

Installation
----------------

Clone the repository git clone git clone https://github.com/CheezPascal/bash-code-project15-randomNumber.git

Navigate into the folder of the repository

cd bash-code-project15-randomNumber


Change the file permission of the program chmod +x 1randomNumber.sh or 2randomNumber.sh


Run the program and follow the menu

./1randomNumber.sh or 2randomNumber.sh

Warnings
-------------------

I added a clear command to the begining of the code to clear the screen, this is because when testing i always cleared the screen and this was repetitive.
